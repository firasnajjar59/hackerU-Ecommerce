              This website is an example of an online store. You can register as
              a subscriber in the store and add products to your favorites and
              the subscriber's shopping cart. You can edit the subscription
              details after registration and upload a profile picture. And if
              the subscriber connects from another device, he will still be able
              to see all the products added to favorites and the shopping cart.
              There are three types of users, the first is a regular user, the
              second is an editor for the website and the third is a super user
              who has access to more options. After adding a product to the
              shopping cart, you can make a payment via Stripe. There is an
              option to track the status of a user's orders under the profile
              tab. Any user who registers on the website can give his opinion on
              a product, etc.

                    with any other library like bootstrap, that's why I wanted

                    The system accepts three types of users, a normal user and
                    is limited in terms of performing actions, the actions that
                    a normal user can perform are adding to favorites or the
                    shopping cart or changing a photo and personal data or
                    making a purchase. The second user is an editor user, this
                    user is much less limited than a normal user but still
                    limited, he can perform all the actions that a normal user
                    performs and in addition can edit products, stock quantity,
                    site content for example add photos to the main gallery of
                    the site, etc. The third user is the strongest user among
                    the three users, he can do everything that the other users
                    can do and in addition can edit two options from the users,
                    one is the user status and the other is blocking and
                    unblocking other users, this is in terms of users.

                    To change user type from normal user to editor or super
                    user, a limited system is built to change user type. Under
                    the profile tab you can access the users and change the type
                    of user and change the status of the user if he is an active
                    user or stop his activity, and even delete the user
                    completely from the database. This is the only option to
                    change the type of user and this system only has access to
                    the super user.
